## User experience review

The design on the **right** provide a better user experience

- _The back arrow (top-left icon):_ aligned with the header content like the title and the more icon on the right the icon

- The header title is visible and readable.
- _The more icons (top right icon)_: The icon is vertically possible along the same axis as the title "Turtles" and the back arrow. The icon is clickable. The recommended font size for the mobile icon is 40px-50px, so it's well within range.
- _The title big image_: The image is not stretch but instead is clear and visible for users to see.
- _The content title_: This is visible and represents what the content is all about.

- _Content header body_: This is easy to read than the read one

- _Second turtle image_: The whole image is shown and not zoomed in.

- The description font is in the right size and easy to read
- _Learn more Button_: Mobile devices button size for the important call to action can be sized at 40-50px. Easy for the user to click it. The button colour white is the right colour blend for the blue background.

_Overall Background colour_: The blue background colour is calmer and communicates the content shown to the user better than the red one on the left.
